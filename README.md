# GameBot
A discord bot that plays games.\
If you want to use this code, you need to install the following modules:
* `discord.py`
* `python-dotenv`

To use the bot, you must first create a discord bot from the developer portal, add it to a server, create a .env file within the directory, declare an environment variable called `TOKEN`, set it equal to the token of your bot, and run `main.py`

Currently, the bot can play rock paper scissors, tic tac toe, mini maze games, a "find the ball in cup" game, and more!
